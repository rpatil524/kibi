# Siren Investigate 10.0-SNAPSHOT

Siren Investigate extends Kibana 5.6.5 with data intelligence features; the core feature of

indexes and from SQL/NOSQL data sources ("external queries").

In addition, Siren Investigate provides UI features and visualizations like dashboard
groups, tabs, cross entity relational navigation buttons, an enhanced search
results table, analytical aggregators, HTML templates on query results, and
much more.
